## Limitations

* Many of the table cells have inline styling to add a background colors.
  * Some of the very common stylings have been replaced using attribute selectors ( e.g. `th[style*="background:#eee"]` ).
  * But due to the sheer number of possiblities, the replaced css style would also need to include selectors such as `th[style*="background-color: #eee"]` and `th[style*="background-color:#EEE"]` and `th[style*="background-color: #eeeeee"]`, etc.
  * It would be a daunting task to find and replace all of these colors. I hope you see my point.
* Not all images can be made readable.
  * This style uses a css filter to invert the images, but this really only works on basic black-and-white images (not the logo).
  * The "Wikipedia" title under the logo is an image and was not inverted because it is part of the logo &amp; it changes depending on the selected language.
